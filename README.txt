OS. Project #3: Creating Dictionary for the AOL Dataset

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For building just run the provided "build.sh" script inside the "src" folder.
The programs will be placed inside the "bin" folder

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the "code" folder you will find the code for each task, each named after the task it corresponds to.
The Trie implementation is separated in a single shared "trie.h" file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to run each program just pass as first argument the path of the dataset folder.
For example, if you want to test the second task - the sequential implementation - just run the following command:

> ./bin/task2 #PATH_TO_THE_DATASET_FOLDER#
